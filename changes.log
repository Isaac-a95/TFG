CHANGELOG

TODOs:


# ----- 08/05
	- Order of calls inside Main loop changed in order to make it more readable and logic
	- Created Parameters.py for input values from user. "Variables" changed to "Parameters" and "var" to "par"
	- Re-used Variables.py for primitive and conservative variables
	- Created Grid.py, which is on charge of building the grid
	************ COMMITED ********************
	- Added comments to every file at the beggining
	- Added Analytic.py module, which computes analytic solution for some given problems
	************ COMMITED ********************
# ----- 09/05
	- Added Operator Splitting for the Source Term (only gravity)
	- Added options to modify the axis scale on Parameters.py
	- Added analytic solution for the isothermal equilibrium
	************ COMMITED ********************
	- Added arrays for the last step variables to compute the mean of the variables at operator splitting step
# ----- 10/05
        - Fixed BCFixedRhoP() energy equation
        - Added FixedT() as a BC
        - Added option to load a grid from a file
        - Added option to load IC from a file
        - Added option for logarithm scale at plot
        - Added temperature plot
        - Changed EOS parameters to allow the use of dimensional variables
        - Added Momentum Damping
        - Default case is the equilibrium given by a file
        ************ COMMITED ********************
        - Added thermal diffusion #WIP#
        - Added radiative losses #WIP#
# ----- 13/05
        - Changed computeDT to take into account the timestep given by the diffusion
        - Added thermal diffusion test case, with an initial gaussian distribution
        ************ COMMITED ********************
# ----- 14/05
        - Added analytical solution for the simple thermal diffusion case
        - Corrected thermal diffusion
        - The initial condition is now saved on an image
